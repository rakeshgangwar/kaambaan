# 13 — Linear Parity Program

How Kaambaan reaches **feature parity with Linear** — the issue tracker whose
interaction model specs [00](./00-vision-and-principles.md) and
[11](./11-prior-art-and-market-scan.md) already borrow. This doc is the program
plan for the work *after* [10 — Roadmap](./10-roadmap.md)'s P0→P7 (we shipped
through **P14 / v0.0.1**; see [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)). It continues the
phase numbering at **P15**.

## 0. The honesty section — parity vs. the locked vision

Kaambaan is **board-first and agent-first**, not an issue tracker that agents
visit. [00](./00-vision-and-principles.md) locks three things that literal Linear
parity presses on. We do **not** silently override them; each is an `⚠️ OPEN`
decision below, and where parity wins, the vision doc must be amended in the same
PR.

| Locked stance (00) | Linear feature that presses on it | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| "**Not a chat app**" — conversation is structured activity, not a thread | Threaded **comments**, @mentions, reactions | **Reconcilable:** model a comment as a new typed activity `comment` on the same append-only log. Discussion lives *on the card as activity*, state is still **derived** (Principle 4 holds). Amend 00 to say "not a *freeform* chat app." → **P16** |
| **Principle 4: state is derived, not declared** | Linear's human-**draggable status** (Todo→In Progress→Done) | **D2 below.** Either keep status fully derived (status = a *view* over stage+task-state) or admit a declared human-status axis as an explicit, audited exception. |
| "**Domain-agnostic**; not coding-only" | Cycles, velocity, sprint burndown (human-team planning) | **Adapt or stub.** These encode *human* cadence; agents have no velocity. Ship the data structures for parity, reframe the metrics (P24), keep the planning machinery thin (P22). |

Everything else in Linear is either a **clean borrow** (✅) or a **reframe that
strengthens the agent thesis** (🟡). The genuinely contested items are marked 🔴.

## 1. Two foundational decisions — resolve before P15

Almost every Linear construct hangs off two containers Kaambaan doesn't yet have.
Settle these first or we rebuild twice.

### ⚠️ OPEN — D1: the Team container

Linear's top level is a **Team** (owns its issues, workflow states, cycles).
Kaambaan's nearest noun ([01](./01-domain-model-and-glossary.md)) is a **Board**,
but a Board is a *pipeline*, not a namespace.

- **Option A — Board = Team.** Cheapest. A Board grows team-like attributes
  (members, labels, states, cycles). Risk: a "team" with many pipelines doesn't fit.
- **Option B — Team over Boards** (a Team has many Boards). Truer to Linear and to
  real orgs (one team, several pipelines). Cost: a new top-level entity threaded
  through tenancy, auth, routing, and every view.
- **Recommendation:** **B.** It's the honest shape and unblocks projects/cycles
  that span boards. Pay it once, early.

### ⚠️ OPEN — D2: status axis vs. pipeline-stage axis

Linear issues carry a **workflow status** (5 categories: backlog / unstarted /
started / completed / canceled) a *human* drives. Kaambaan cards carry a
**pipeline stage** (an agent work-routing slot) plus an A2A **task-state**
([03](./03-card-lifecycle.md)) that is *derived*. Parity needs a human-facing
status; the question is whether it's a **second axis** or a **projection**.

- **Option A — projection (keep Principle 4).** Status is a deterministic *view*
  over `(stage category, task-state)`. No new declared field. Purest, but loses
  Linear's "drag an issue to In Progress" affordance.
- **Option B — declared status axis (audited exception).** Add a real status field
  humans can set, recorded as a typed activity so it stays attributable. Parity-true,
  but a deliberate dent in "state is derived."
- **Recommendation:** **A with a thin B affordance** — derive by default; allow an
  explicit human status *override* that is itself a logged activity (so derivation
  + override are both visible). Resolve in **P19**.

## 3. Phased delivery (P15+)

Same rule as [10](./10-roadmap.md): each phase is a **working, tested vertical
slice**, landing with the suites from [09](./09-testing-strategy.md). Phases
within a group are largely parallelizable; **P15 and P19 are the critical path**.

### Group 1 — Card depth & collaboration

**P15 — Card depth.** Sub-cards (parent/child + rollup), card↔card relations
(blocks/blocked-by/related/duplicate), labels-management UI, due dates, point
estimates, custom-field schemas. The data-model spine for half of Linear; extends
[01](./01-domain-model-and-glossary.md). *⚠️ OPEN: do sub-cards run their own
pipeline, or are they checklist items on the parent's pipeline?*

**P16 — Comments & notifications.** A `comment` typed activity on the existing
append-only log (state stays derived — Principle 4), @mentions, reactions,
markdown; notification fan-out to **inbox + email + Slack + push**. Amends 00's
"not a chat app" to "not a *freeform* chat app." Builds on
[07](./07-realtime-and-ui.md).

### Group 2 — Navigation & "the feel"

**P17 — Command palette + search.** Cmd+K (nav + actions + search), full-text
search across cards/activities/comments (DO SQLite FTS or per-tenant D1 index),
and the comprehensive keyboard layer. ~70% of what makes Linear *feel* like Linear.

**P18 — Views infrastructure.** Saved / named / shared views, favorites, and a
general filter/group/sort/order engine over every field. Generalizes today's
ephemeral filters.

### Group 3 — Team & workflow model

**P19 — Teams + states + triage.** Implements **D1** and **D2**: the Team
container, customizable workflow states living *alongside* pipeline stages, and a
**triage inbox** that generalizes gates / "needs you" into one queue. The second
critical-path phase.

**P20 — Templates & automation.** Card/project templates (reuse the board-template
machinery) + a **rule engine** ("when X → assign/move/notify") that doubles as
agent-routing automation. Ties to the `pipeline` vs `manager` routing in
[10/P7](./10-roadmap.md).

### Group 4 — Planning constructs (contested)

**P21 — Projects.** Projects, milestones, project updates, documents. 🟡 Useful as
"group related cards toward a goal," spanning boards (needs D1=B).

**P22 — Cycles.** 🔴 Sprints / velocity / rollover. Ship the entity for parity;
**stub the velocity machinery** (agents have no cadence). *⚠️ OPEN: do we expose
cycles at all, or alias them to time-boxed views?*

**P23 — Roadmap & temporal views.** Initiatives, Roadmap, Timeline/Gantt, Calendar.
🟡 Calendar is cheap and useful — ship early. 🔴 Roadmap/Gantt are human-strategy
artifacts; treat as polish.

**P24 — Insights.** 🟡 **Reframe, don't copy.** Linear shows velocity/cycle-time;
Kaambaan's native equivalents are **cost-per-card, success/failure rate,
time-in-stage, agent throughput, gate-rejection rate** — we already meter cost
per activity ([07 §6](./07-realtime-and-ui.md)). This is parity *and* a
differentiator ([11 §5](./11-prior-art-and-market-scan.md)).

### Group 5 — Integrations & ingestion

**P25 — Integration breadth.** Deeper GitHub (branch naming, auto-close, status
sync), GitLab, **two-way Slack incl. Asks** (a message → a card — just another
inbound trigger, [05](./05-integration-surfaces.md)), Sentry, Zendesk/Intercom.
Parallelizable.

**P26 — Import & customer requests.** Jira/Asana/GitHub/CSV importers; customer-
request capture funneling to cards.

### Group 6 — Enterprise & platform

**P27 — RBAC + audit + guests.** Enforce owner/admin/member/viewer through API +
UI (today they exist in the catalog but aren't enforced); formalize the activity
log into an audit surface; guest/limited access.

**P28 — SSO/SAML + SCIM.** Enterprise auth + provisioning. Gate on having buyers.

**P29 — Mobile apps.** Native iOS/Android. XL; defer unless demanded.

**P30 — Sync engine + theming.** 🔴 Linear's offline-capable, instantly-optimistic
client is its real moat and a multi-quarter effort. **Recommendation: declare the
per-board DO + WebSocket the "good-enough" answer and skip true offline sync**
unless a customer requires it. Light/dark theming ships here cheaply regardless.
*⚠️ OPEN: attempt the local-first sync engine, or formally decline it?*

## 4. Effort & sequencing

| Phase | Theme | Effort | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| P15 | Card depth | L | D1?, schema |
| P16 | Comments & notifications | L | P15 |
| P17 | Cmd+K + search | M–L | — |
| P18 | Views infra | M | P17 |
| P19 | Teams + states + triage | L | **D1, D2** |
| P20 | Templates + automation | L | P19 |
| P21 | Projects | L | P19 |
| P22 | Cycles | M | P21 |
| P23 | Roadmap/temporal views | L | P21 |
| P24 | Insights (agent telemetry) | M | metering |
| P25 | Integration breadth | L (parallel) | — |
| P26 | Import + customer requests | M–L | P21 |
| P27 | RBAC + audit + guests | M | D1 |
| P28 | SSO/SAML/SCIM | L | P27 |
| P29 | Mobile apps | XL | stable API |
| P30 | Sync engine + theming | XL / S | — |

**Critical path:** the two decisions (D1, D2) → **P15** (data model) → **P19**
(teams/states). Groups 1–3 (P15–P20) deliver the *felt* parity in ~4–5 months;
Groups 4–6 are the long, lower-ROI tail. The 🔴 items (P22 cycles, P23 roadmap/
Gantt, P30 sync engine) are where "literal parity" costs the most for the least
agent fit — recommended to stub/decline, included here because full parity was the
chosen scope.

## 5. Open decisions added by this program

Tracked the same way as [10's](./10-roadmap.md) closing list — resolved at their phase:

- **D1** — Board = Team vs. Team-over-Boards. *(blocks P19, P21, P27)*
- **D2** — status as derived projection vs. declared audited axis. *(blocks P19)*
- Sub-card semantics — own pipeline vs. parent checklist. *(P15)*
- Cycles — expose vs. alias to time-boxed views. *(P22)*
- Local-first sync engine — attempt vs. formally decline. *(P30)*
- Vision amendments — does parity change 00's "not a chat app" / Principle 4
  non-goals, and are we comfortable making that explicit? *(P16, P19)*

## 6. Patterns to borrow (June 2026 scan)

A re-scan of the field ([11 §6](./11-prior-art-and-market-scan.md)) surfaced concrete,
transferable patterns. Split into what **validates what we already have** (don't rebuild) and what
is **net-new to adopt**, each tagged with where it lands.

**Already validated — keep, don't rebuild.** Temporal's heartbeat-timeout reclaim +
progress-carrying heartbeats = our lease/epoch spine
([08](./08-reliability-and-durable-execution.md)); GitHub's requester-can't-approve gate = our
separation-of-duties ([03](./03-card-lifecycle.md)); Linear's delegate-not-owner = Principle 3;
board-as-MCP-server (Vibe Kanban) = our [05](./05-integration-surfaces.md) surface; Cloudflare
`waitForEvent` (parked = zero compute) = our durable gate. The field converged on our design —
these are confidence, not work.

### A. Into the parity program (board/UX — map to phases)

- **Agent-session card UI** (Linear) — a live status row + an agent **"plan" checklist** + the full
  typed stream, adding explicit **`elicitation`→awaiting-input** and **`error`** rendering (we ship
  `thought|action|response` today). → **P16** + [07](./07-realtime-and-ui.md).
- **Omni-channel Triage inbox** (Tegon, Linear Asks) — consolidated intake → AI metadata suggestion
  → routing, with accept / dismiss / **inspect-reasoning**. → **P19** (triage) + **P25/P26** (intake).
- **Run-as-artifact progress stream** (GitHub) — 👀-ack the instant a card is claimed; agent
  self-decomposes into a watchable checklist; draft-PR-as-progress-surface. → **P16**, ties to
  [06](./06-external-references.md).
- **Mid-run steering** (GitHub Agent HQ) — pause / refine / restart a *running* card, beyond
  approve/reject; extends our `stop` signal. → new verb in [04](./04-agent-contract.md); surface in **P16**.
- **Card-to-card dependency edges that auto-trigger downstream** (Cline, agent-kanban) — pipeline
  autopilot beyond linear stages. → **P15** (relations) + **P20** (automation).
- **Acceptance-criteria as a structured card field** + a dedicated **verifier stage** (Factory,
  Intent, Devin) — agents must satisfy explicit criteria; "verify against spec" becomes its own
  gated stage. → **P15** (custom fields) + [03](./03-card-lifecycle.md).
- **Plan-as-living-spec approval gate** (Intent, Devin, Magentic co-planning) — a human-approved
  plan stage *before* execution. → [03](./03-card-lifecycle.md) + **P20** templates.
- **Mobile approval companion** (GitHub, Nimbalyst, Factory) — a thin phone view to approve/steer.
  → **P29** (or an earlier thin slice).

### B. Evolve the gate & contract ([03](./03-card-lifecycle.md) / [04](./04-agent-contract.md) / [08](./08-reliability-and-durable-execution.md))

- **Gate response triad: approve / reject-with-feedback / modify** (HumanLayer + AG-UI) — we have
  approve/request-changes/reject; add **modify** (human edits the proposed handoff before it
  proceeds), and thread reject-feedback into the next claim's **handoff**. *Our single biggest
  gate-design call.*
- **Risk-/confidence-driven two-tier gating** (Magentic-UI Action Guards, AG-UI risk levels, Sema4
  fail-closed, Preloop) — gate only high-stakes/low-confidence actions; add a lightweight
  **`require-justification`** (agent logs a rationale, no human block) between "ungated" and "full
  gate"; promote trusted repeated patterns to ungated. Deepens [11 §2.7](./11-prior-art-and-market-scan.md).
- **Opaque state round-trip** (HumanLayer) — attach a context blob to `submit_for_review` returned
  verbatim on resolve, so a gate is reconstructable without server-side session state (fits our
  append-only log).
- **Dead-letter cap on reclaim** (DBOS `max_recovery_attempts`) — track a reclaim count and route a
  poison card to "needs human / dead-letter" after N, instead of re-dispatching forever. Closes a
  gap beside our circuit breaker.
- **`auth-required` vs `input-required` as distinct gate types** (A2A v1.0) — separate "needs a
  human decision" from "needs a credential" in the gate UX (both already in our state machine).
- **Per-gate timeout policy (skip / end / reassign) + collect structured inputs in the gate**
  (Relay.app, Windmill N-of-M) — the human-layer mirror of heartbeat/reclaim; a gate can request a
  *value*, not just a verdict. The design source for deferred **P3.1** (gate timeout/escalation/quorum).
- **Three-way idempotent gate completion** (Trigger.dev) — resolve a gate from the **UI, a webhook,
  or the SDK**, all idempotent, with a queryable "pending approvals" list.

### C. Observability & cost ([07](./07-realtime-and-ui.md))

- **Versioned pricing-table cost model** (LangSmith) — regex model match + **activation-dated
  prices** + per-token-type accounting (cache-read/reasoning) + `usage_metadata` injection. We meter
  cost already; activation-dated price versioning is the detail home-grown meters miss.
- **OTel GenAI semantic conventions** (MS Agent Framework, CrewAI, Google) — emit OTel spans
  alongside our typed activity log for free interop with external observability backends.
- **AG-UI state snapshot + JSON-Patch deltas** — adopt as the wire format for streaming card/activity
  state without resending full state (we already use AG-UI adapters).

### D. External-agent governance & onboarding ([04](./04-agent-contract.md) / [05](./05-integration-surfaces.md))

- **Identity + Registry + Gateway triad** (Google) + **signed A2A agent cards**
  (`/.well-known/agent-card.json`) — self-describing capability onboarding, an approved-agent
  registry, and a policy gateway on every external dispatch; **cryptographic per-agent identity**
  (agent-kanban) hardens trust beyond bearer tokens.
- **`auth.md` registration** (WorkOS) — a discoverable front door telling external agents which OAuth
  flows/scopes exist and how scoped tokens are issued/revoked (we already mint scoped agent tokens).
- **Selective MCP tool loading** (Task Master) — don't dump all verbs into every agent's context;
  load per-capability to cut tokens.

**Top 5 highest-leverage** (if we adopt nothing else): (1) the **approve/reject/modify** gate triad
with feedback-into-handoff; (2) the **agent-session card UI** with elicitation/error + plan checklist;
(3) the **omni-channel triage inbox**; (4) **risk-driven two-tier gating** + `require-justification`;
(5) the **versioned cost model**. The first two are parity-critical; the rest sharpen the agent thesis.
